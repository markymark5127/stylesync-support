    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 15, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how StyleSync AI handles your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe experience.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>StyleSync AI does <strong>not collect or store personal information</strong>. The app temporarily processes images you upload in order to analyze your outfit. These images are not saved or linked to your identity.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
    <p>Your photos are used solely to evaluate color compatibility and outfit matching using AI. Once processed, images are discarded automatically. No data is sold, shared, or reused.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our backend may use third-party APIs (such as OpenAI) to perform the outfit analysis. These services may receive your image during the analysis process but do not store or retain this data afterward.</p>

    <h2>4. Tracking</h2>
    <p>We do not use any analytics tools, cookies, or user tracking technologies in the app.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this policy, contact us at: <a href="mailto:markmayne@ymail.com">markmayne@ymail.com</a></p>

    <h2>6. Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
    <p>StyleSync and its creator participate in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites and apps to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</p>

    <p>We may show shopping links to third-party retailers based on the clothing you upload. These links are generated to match your outfit context, but we do not track your identity, app usage, or behavior across other apps or websites.</p>

    
    <h2>7. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>StyleSync+ is an optional subscription that unlocks premium features such as enhanced outfit analysis and increased photo limits. Subscriptions are billed through your Apple ID and will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple Account settings.</p>


    <p>By using StyleSync AI, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
